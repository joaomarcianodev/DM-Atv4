- The application starts with default values, with a password length of 16 and the "Letters" option enabled.  
- The user can set the password length, between 8 and 32 characters, using the slider.  
- It is possible to choose which character sets will be part of the password:  
  - Letters (lowercase)  
  - Uppercase and lowercase  
  - Numbers  
  - Special characters  
- The application validates that at least one character set option remains active, preventing the user from disabling all of them.  
- By clicking the "Generate password" button, a new random password is created according to the selected settings and displayed on the screen.  
- The user can click the "Click to copy" link to copy the generated password to the device's clipboard.  
- The generated password field allows for manual text selection for copying.
